Constant functions / variables

domain:
    having const getters. because you don't want to change anything about them, you just recieve information.


Naming conventions:

domain:
    class should start with uppercase
    private member variables should start with "m_"
    simple names for funtions. From "getTaskId" -> "getId".


Header files should include other header files!

Sets are cool. You can store unique and ordered elements. You can apply binary search on sets to make faster searches.
